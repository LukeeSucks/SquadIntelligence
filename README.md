# Squad Community Bot

## Developers:
- Lukee
- Willy Wanker

The Squad Community Bot is a Discord bot designed to help educate and inform Squad game players and the community. The bot offers a range of commands that provide detailed information about the game, including statistics on every vehicle, information on every map and its individual layers, statistics and information on each faction, and much more. The aim is to provide players with a more enjoyable and fun experience, whether they are new or experienced players. 
This bot wouldn't have been possible without the help of the community and expecially the Squad Wiki in which we are happy to announce our new partnership with!
